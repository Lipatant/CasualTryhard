## <a id="titre1"></a>1. The purpose of the project


The goal of this project was to create a game based on a theme.
The project lasted a week-end, from 8th to 10th of december 2023.
The theme of this gameJam was **Game**.


## <a id="titre2"></a>2. The goal of our game

Our game took inspirations from many games. Our idea was to create a
WarioWare like game with some inspirations of Fever.

When Starting, the player will have to complete the minigames in 5 seconds.
If he fails to accomplish the game or run out of time, he loose a life. A game
is lost after three lives.

The goal is to go as far as you can !


## <a id="titre3"></a>3.How to launch the game

The game was made on Godot, a tool to make games easely.

You can start the game by simply launching the executable at the root of the project.
